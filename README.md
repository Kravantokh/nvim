# nvim
My Neovim configuration. The repository has `nvim` as the name so that it can be directly cloned into `.config` on linux or `Roaming\Local` on Windows and it will automatically have the correct name to be recognized by neovim. I use this configuration on a laptop and a pc and the reason for making this repository is so that I can more easily update the configuration on either one..
